Thread Jammer™: A Retrocausal Security Framework for Disrupting Predictive Exploitation

## Abstract:

- Thread Jammer™ is a conceptual and technical framework for behavioral security systems designed to rupture predictive threads in modern cyber-physical ecosystems, such as electric vehicles, smart devices, and human-computer interfaces. It is based on the principle that unconscious behavioral sequences, once initiated, follow deterministic patterns exploitable by recommendation engines, surveillance systems, and adversarial agents.

- This system proposes a triadic architecture:
  <ul> 
    <li> Predictive Thread Mapping – identifies behavioral trajectories and assesses their predictability index. </li>
    <li> Anti-Predictive Insertion – injects micro-variations or obfuscatory noise into interaction loops to collapse exploitative prediction without affecting core functionality. </li>
    <li> Retrocausal Feedback Layer – forecasts future exploit attempts and modifies current behavior to mask or mislead those futures, establishing a form of soft retrocausality in defense logic. </li> 
  </ul>

- By targeting the continuity of unconscious user behavior and data flow, Thread Jammer™ reclaims autonomy from deterministic systems and challenges the epistemic power of surveillance capitalism. It has applications in user privacy, AI deception resistance, and conscious technology design.

- This repository is intended as both a philosophical challenge and a technical springboard for future implementations in code, simulation environments, or integrated security architectures.
